      <img src="assets/images/JakeYolles.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name" style="width:200px;height:200px;">

      <p>I was born in Boulder, Colorado. After my birth I was moved down to Denver. I grew up in Denver for the rest of my life. </p>

      <p>In high school I played cross country and a bit of football as a Quarterback. A few fun facts about me: I am a certified life guard, and archery instructor.</p>   

      <p>In college I studied Genetic Engineering initially. I changed my major and ended up graduating with a major in English Literature and a minor in Politcal Science.
        During my freshman and softmore year, I played Ice Hockey.</p>
